# Custom Jellyfish UI
Don't look at this

This is basically a custom UI for Jellyfish that I made to experiment.  Basically it gives you the same thing except for it also allows you to have a chroma gamer rainbow theme without being called gay by the application.

# How to use/install it
1. Install Jellyfish UI here at https://jellyfish.thelmgn.com.
2. After installing it, go to the "tools" section in the application and scroll down.  Under "Jellyfish Options", look for a text-input-box with a `Set Theme` button next to it.
3. There, input `Jminding/custom-jellyfish-ui` and click the `Set Theme` button.  Then agree to restart the UI.
4. There you go!  You can now have a rainbow chroma gamer theme.  Check the checkbox `Chroma Theme` to turn it on.
